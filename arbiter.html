    <p >The title of Arbiter was meant for the pinnacle of the Sangheili, a master of the battle-field,<br> 
        who would lead all the clans. It became the highest possible honor bestowed upon a Covenant Sangheili<br>
         by the Hierarchs during a time of great need. It was the greatest religious rank of the Sangheili, although the<br>
         Sangheili High Councilor is considered to have superior political and military status.<br> 
         That was, until one Arbiter challenged the words of the Prophets and lost, which caused the title to be a badge of shame.<br> 
         But the rank was returned to its full glory shortly before the Great Schism.<br>

        The Arbiter acted as a sort of field marshal,<br>
         going on missions for the Prophets and during incidents such as<br>
          the Taming of the Lekgolo, the Unggoy Rebellion, the Human-Covenant war, and most recently,<br>
           the threat of the Heretics. Until the Arbiter Thel 'Vadam incited a <br>
           brigade against the Covenant Empire, where the Arbiter once more lead all of Sangheili toward victory.<br>
        
        Arbiters were sent on the<br> most perilous and daunting missions in desperate times for the Covenant Empire,<br>
         and in those times the missions are often tantamount to suicide. On those missions, the Arbiter is expected to die <br>
         and be revered thereafter as another great martyr of the Covenant on their path to the Great Journey. </p>
